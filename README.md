# Employee SQL Database

## Background
It's been two weeks since you were hired as anew data egineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to design tables to hold data from CSV files, import CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. 

## Technologies
* PostgreSQL
* QuickDBD
* Python

## Instructions
Perform the following on the CSV files:
* Data Modeling - Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the       tables.
* Data Engineering - Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
* Data Analysis
